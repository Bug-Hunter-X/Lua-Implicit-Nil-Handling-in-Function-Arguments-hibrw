This repository demonstrates a common subtle bug in Lua related to how functions handle nil arguments. The 'bug.lua' file shows a simple function that fails silently when called without an argument. The 'bugSolution.lua' file provides a corrected version that explicitly checks for nil arguments and handles them appropriately.  This showcases the importance of robust nil checks in Lua to prevent unexpected behavior and improve code reliability.
